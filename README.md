# CloudfilerV2

CloudfilerV2 is a rewrite of the older project in ReactJs that queries Google Drive API and returns information on the drive folder/file via it's URL. Also, it generates raw HTML markup for an undisclosed site (you can ignore that specific component). Furthermore, the code is not the best, so critiques and suggestions are always welcome!

## To-Do
- [ ] Refactor code and project structure
- [ ] Use OAuth 2.0 to access the Google Drive API instead of using an API key
- [ ] Add sorting options to the Folder Information (Sort by Size)
